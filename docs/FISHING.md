# Fishing Plugin

The Fishing Plugin is an example automation script built using the Kraken API. 
It demonstrates how to create a script that can be used across different areas and uses the `Widget` and `PriorityTask` API's 
to structure itself.

## Features
- Automatic fishing at several locations including
  - Karamja Musa Point
  - Draynor Village Shrimps
  - Barbarian Village Salmon and Trout
- It can automatically cook food at the Barbarian village location
- Multiple options for "smart" dropping of caught fish

## Requirements & Usage
To use this plugin effectively, please ensure the following:

1. **Rod/Feathers/Small Net/Cage/Harpoon**: You must have the appropriate fishing gear in your inventory for your location
2. **Starting Location**: Your character must be located at or near one of the starting locations.
3. **Inventory**: Start with an **empty inventory** (except for your fishing equipment if it is not equipped).

## Limitations

- **Location** - The script only works in the 3 aforementioned locations.
- **Cooking** - Cooking is only supported at the barbarian village location

## Running the Plugin
To run the mining plugin, use the following commands in your terminal:

```shell
./gradlew build

java -jar ./build/libs/kraken-example-plugin-1.0.0.jar --developer-mode com.krakenplugins.example.fishing.FishingPlugin
```

## Configuration
The plugin offers several configuration options to customize its behavior.

### Mouse Settings
* **Movement Strategy**: Determines how the mouse moves. Options include `BEZIER` (default), `LINEAR`, etc.
* **Replay Library**: If `REPLAY` strategy is chosen, this defines which library to load.
* **Linear Steps**: If `LINEAR` strategy is chosen, this sets the number of steps (points) along the path (5-3000).

### Overlays
* **Highlight Fishing Spot**: Visualizes which spot the script is currently targeting.
* **Render Path**: Draws the path the player is currently walking on the screen.
